Hello :wave:! <br>

Glad to see you here. You'll find projects in **JavaScript** as I am most comfortable with it. However, I am catching up with **Rust** and **Go** projects.

The most recent project I've been working on is [**Sinix**](https://github.com/sinix-dev). I am planning on setting up a serverless infra in **Go** for **Sinix Store**. Will see how it'll turn out.
